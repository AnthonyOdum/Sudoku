# Sudoku

How To Play:

In Sudoku the player is given a 9x9 grid with some cells filled, while other cells are empty (Marked by 0).
The goal of the game is to fill each row, column and 3x3 subgrid with the numbers 1 - 9. However, these numbers can only
occur once! The player will enter the coordinates of the cell that they would like to try and fill, as well as the guess
they want to fill it with.

Example:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9              
4 5 6            
7 8 9            
2                 
3                 
6                  
8                   
9                   
5                   

As you can see in the above example, there is only one occurence of each number in the row, column and 3x3 subgrid.
This will need to be done for the entire 9x9 board.

You can make 5 mistakes and the time is unlimited. You will be prompted as to whether your guess was correct or incorrect.
